# Twin Rotor Control Project

## Overview

This project simulates and analyzes the dynamics of a Twin Rotor system as part of the Classic Control Engineering course at the German International University. The work includes deriving the equations of motion, implementing them in MATLAB, and testing system behavior under various conditions.

## Contents

- Equation of Motion derivation
- MATLAB simulation of open-loop system
- Scenario testing with disturbances and parameter changes
- Graphs and performance analysis

## How to Run

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Load the source files.
3. Run the simulation script to view system response.
4. Analyze results using the provided plots and comments.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (R2024b)
- Basic understanding of classical control systems 

## Contributors

- Instructor: Dr. Lobna Tarek  
- TA: Mostafa Elsayed

## Notes

This project is submitted for academic evaluation under the Classic Control Engineering course. Do not reuse without permission.
