# Twin Rotor Control Project

## Overview

This project Models, simulates, and analyzes the dynamics of a Twin Rotor system as part of the "Classic Control Engineering" and "Modelling and Simulation of Dynamic Systems" courses at the German International University. The work includes deriving the equations of motion and state space matricies, implementing them in MATLAB, testing system behavior under various conditions and applying PID control.

## Contents

- Equations of motion derivation
- State space matricies derivation
- MATLAB simulation of open-loop system
- Scenario testing with disturbances and parameter changes
- Graphs and performance analysis
- PID control of closed-loop system

## How to Run

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Load the source files.
3. Run the simulation script to view system response.
4. Analyze results using the provided plots and comments.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (R2024b)
- Basic understanding of classical control systems and Modelling

## Contributors

- Instructor: Dr. Lobna Tarek  
- TA: MSc. Mayar Hisham, Eng. Omar Hemeda, Eng. Saleh Abdallah, Eng. Mohamed Abdelhamid, Eng.Mostafa Elsayed
